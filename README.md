# Energy trends in Europe: An analysis of the European Union's Energy Transition

In this project, I analyze the European Union's ongoing energy transition, a cornerstone of its long-term strategy. The EU's energy policy is built to address three main challenges while pursuing the ultimate goal of climate neutrality by 2050:
- ensuring a secure and safe energy supply,
- ensuring affordable energy for businesses and citizens to support competitiveness,
- promoting clean, sustainably energy production and use.

At the core of this goal are landmark policies like the European Green Deal and the "Fit for 55" package, which provide a comprehensive roadmap for transforming the continent's economy and energy systems. This strategy aims to fundamentally reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease reliance on volatile foreign enemy markets, and foster innovation in green technologies.

All data used in this project comes from Eurostat, the official statistical office of the European Union. The latest figures available for all metrics are up to and including 2023.

# I. Key Metrics and Their Relevance

### Energy Share from Renewables
Renewable energy sources can be used to generate electricity and heat. These sources, such as solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal and biomass, replenish themselves naturally and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. A higher share of energy from renewables signals a shift towards sustainable energy systems.

Under the revised Renewable Energy Directive, the EU's binding target for **2030** is to have **42,5%** of total energy come from renewables, with aspirations to reach 45%.

### Energy Imports Dependency
Most countries are reliant on energy imports to meet their domestic needs. Energy products which are imported include sollid fossil fuels, anthractice, coal, lignite, oil and petroleum products, peat and natural gas.

This metric measures the ratio of a country's net energy imports to its total energy consumption. Higher values indicate a greater reliance on external sources for energy supply. In response to geopolitical risks, especially after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the EU aims to reduce its reliance on Russian fossil fuels by 2030, and ultimately become **energy independent**.

### Final Energy Consumption
This metric measures the energy-end use in a country, covering the energy consumed by end users such as industry, transport, households, services and agriculture, excluding losses in energy transformation and distribution. It is measured in Millions of tonnes of oil equivalent(Mtoe)

While high consumption is not inherently negative, it often correlates with energy inefficiency and increased emissions. The EU has set a target to cut final energy consumption by **11,7%** by 2030 compared to projections made in 2020.

### Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Greenhouse gases(GHG) trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to climate change and increased temperatures. Although naturally occurring, human activities like industrial processes and burning fossil fuels significantly increase their concentration. Eurostat reports on emissions of CO2, NO2, CH4, HFC, PFC, SF6 and NF3 measured in Million tonnes of CO2 equivalent(Mt).

The EU's climate law mandates a **55%** reduction in net GHG emissions compared to 1990 levels, and aims for **net-zero emissions by 2050**.

# II. Current Status & 2030 Outlook
To better visualize trends and understand how different EU member states are progressing, I have built an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore these key metrics for each country. You can view the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/viktor.krstevski/viz/EuropeEnergyTransition/Dashboard).

### Renewable Energies
The EU has managed to considerably increase the share of energy from renewable sources over the years, from **9,6%** in 2004 to **17,4%** in 2014, reaching **24,6%** in 2023.

Northern Europe leads the way: Iceland and Norway exceed **70%**, with Sweden and Finland close behind. Conversely, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Malta hover around **15%**, trailing behind non-EU countries like Montenegro and Albania.

At the current growth rate, it's projected the EU will reach **32%** by 2030, which is on track with their original goal, but below the revised **42,5%** target. Achieving the current target requires a significant acceleration, but historical trends show no indicators that such a big increase is possible.

### Energy Import Dependency

The EU's import dependency has fluctuated between **54%** and **63%** since 2000, settling in at **58%** in 2023. 

Norway stands out as a net exporter, with exports nearly seven times their domestic consumption. Among member states, Estonia has reduced dependency from **34%** in 2000 to just **3%** in 2023. However, most countries are struggling, and both small states and major economies import large shares of their energy:

Although the pivot away from Russian energy has shown results, the EU has instead become dependent on other suppliers, and this metric remains largely unchanged for two decades, with both EU members and non-members still remaining reliant on imports. 

### Final Energy Consumption
From 2005 to 2023, the EU cut final energy consumption by **123 Mtoe**. Most countries followed this trend, with leaders in this metric such as Germany and France reducing their energy consumption compared to past values. Two exceptions exist, with Turkey doubling its energy consumption over the last 15 years, and Poland also having an increase. These changes are partially brought on by socioeconomic growth leading to increased energy demand and industrial activity.

With 5 years to go, the target of **763 Mtoe** for 2030 is still within reach. The value for 2023 represents a 5,6% reduction from 2021 in a tough period marked by high energy prices and economic shifts. Reaching the 2030 target would require sustaining an average annual reduction of **2%**, which certainly appears feasible.

### Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Between 2014 and 2023, EU emissions fell by **528 Mt**(3 435 -> 2 907 Mt), making the EU the world's fourth-largest emitter after China, the USA, and India. Three member states - Germany, France and Italy, account for **48%** of EU emissions, yet each has also reduced emissions over the same period(Germany: 904 -> 741 Mt; France: 414 -> 339 Mt; Italy: 393 -> 331 Mt).

Current emissions represent a **41%** reduction from the 1990 baseline levels of 4 920 Mt. To meet the 2030 reduction target(**2 214 Mt**), the EU would have to eliminate an additional **663 Mt**, which means cutting down a further **24%** from 2023 values.

# III. Conclusion

The European Union has made substantial strides in its energy transition over the past two decades, yet the path to achieving its 2030 and 2050 climate goals remains demanding. Renewable energy adoption has grown steadily, but current trends suggest that the EU might fall short of its ambitious **42,5%** target unless significant acceleration occurs. Energy import dependency continues to be a critical vulnerability, with limited progress in reducing reliance on external sources despite policy efforts.

On the efficiency front, reductions in final energy consumption are promising, and with sustained annual improvements, the EU's consumption targets are within reach. Notable reductions have also been achieved in greenhouse gas emissions, but the biggest challenge remains in improving these efforts within the next five years.

The data reveals the EU is progressing, but not yet at the pace its climate ambitions demand. Bridging the gap between the current numbers and goals will require incremental improvements, bold policy enforcement, technological innovation and unwavering commitment.
