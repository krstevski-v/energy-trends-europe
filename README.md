# Energy trends in Europe: An analysis of the European Union's Energy Transition

In this project, I analyze the European Union's ongoing energy transition, a cornerstone of its long-term strategy. The EU's energy policy is build to address three main challenges while pursuing the ultimate goal of climate neutrality by 2050:
- ensuring a secure and safe energy supply,
- ensuring affordable energy for businesses and citizens to support competitiveness,
- promoting clean, sustainably energy production and use.

At the core of this goal are landmark policies like the European Green Deal and the "Fit for 55" package, which provide a comprehensive roadmap for transforming the continent's economy and energy systems. This strategy aims to fundamentally reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease reliance on volatile foreign enemy markets, and foster innovation in green technologies.

All data used in this project comes from Eurostat, the official statistical office of the European Union. The latest figures available for all metrics are up to and including 2023.

# I. Key Metrics and Their Relevance

## Energy Share from Renewables
Renewable energy sources can be used to generate electricity and heat. These sources, such as solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal and biomass, replenish themselves naturally and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. A higher share of energy from renewables signals a shift towards sustainable energy systems.

Under the revised Renewable Energy Directive, the EU's binding target for 2030 is to have 42,5% of total energy come from renewables, with aspirations to reach 45%.

## Energy Imports Dependency
Most countries are reliant on energy imports to meet their domestic needs. Energy products which are imported include sollid fossil fuels, anthractice, coal, lignite, oil and petroleum products, peat and natural gas.

This metric measures the ratio of a country's net energy imports to its total energy consumption. Higher values indicate a greater reliance on external sources for energy supply. In response to geopolitical risks, especially after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the EU aims to reduce its reliance on Russian fossil fuels by 2030, and ultimately become energy independent.

## Final Energy Consumption
This metric measures the energy-end use in a country, covering the energy consumed by end users such as industry, transport, households, services and agriculture, excluding losses in energy transformation and distribution. It is measured in Millions of tonnes of oil equivalent(Mtoe)

While high consumption is not inherently negative, it often correlates with energy inefficiency and increased emissions. The EU has set a target to cut final energy consumption by 11,7% by 2030 compared to projections made in 2020.

## Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Greenhouse gases(GHG) trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to climate change and increased temperatures. Although naturally occurring, human activities like industrial processes and burning fossil fuels significantly increase their concentration. Eurostat reports on emissions of CO2, NO2, CH4, HFC, PFC, SF6 and NF3 measured in Million tonnes of CO2 equivalent(Mt).

The EU's climate law mandates a 55% reduction in net GHG emissions compared to 1990 levels, and aims for net-zero emissions by 2050.
